      <title>George’s Cheese/Pizza Revenge (feat. Alison Pill and Josh Sharp)</title>
      <description>Meghan reveals the mystery of her porpoise-full past and must heal a rift between her porpoise protege Travis (Josh Sharp) and the intimidating Mother Porpoise (Alison Pill). This week’s episode features two new stories: "George's Cheese," the tale of an easily-startled pig who wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting town, written by a 5th grader from Virginia named Micah and "Pizza Revenge," a salsa-inflected jam about a viral video that forever changes the battle between pizza and hot dogs, written by a 5th grader from Arkansas named Lillie.

      <title>In the Car/The Girl Who Couldn't Stop Reading - AKA Me! (feat. Santino Fontana)</title>
      <description>The Story Pirates meet a magical hermit crab (Santino Fontana) who either doesn’t believe in himself or isn’t actually magical, but that doesn’t stop the gang from making lots of wishes! Today's episode features two new stories: "In the Car," a bonkers, deliciously-autotuned pop explosion about the wonders you behold from inside your ride by 5 year old Leah from Maryland and "The Girl Who Couldn't Stop Reading - AKA Me!," a semi-autobiographical tale of a ambitious girl who won’t let the world stop her from reading every book ever written, by a 4th grader from Arizona named Lila.

      <description>After months of seafaring on a nameless ship, the Story Pirates finally decide what to call their vessel. Best of all, the new ship name comes from one of our listeners! This weeks episode features two new stories: "How the Grizzly Bear Turned Into a Polar Bear," a catchy acoustic jam about a grizzly bear with an identity crisis by a 1st grader named Max from Colorado, and "Boogerman's Trial," a courtroom drama about a man made of boogers and his grudge against the ocean, by a 3rd grader named Finn from Maryland.
